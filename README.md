Techdegree Project 4 Object Oriented Programming Game Show App

OOP Game Show App is a browser based game in which player has to guess movie quotes. Every time the game runs it generates another movie quote and hides it under tills. At the beggining of the game, a player sees the tilles representing hidden movie phrase. A player clickes a keyboard letter (in window or phisicall). When the letter exists in the phrase, it unveils at the right place in hidden phrase. When a player doesn't guess the right letter he loses one life. All clicked keyboard buttons can be clicked only once they unveil all matching letters in a hidden phrase, after this they get disabled. A player continues to guess letters until the phrase is guessed or there are no lives left.<br><br>
This project is based on plain vanilla and object oriented programming.<br>
