Techdegree Project 4 Object Oriented Programming Game Show App

OOP Game Show App is a browser based game in which player has to guess movie quotes. Every time the game runs it generates new movie quote and hides it under tiles. When player clickes a keyboard letter (in window or phisical) the program checks if the letter exists in the phrase. If the letter exists in the phrase, it is unveiled if not player loses one "life". All keyboard buttons can be clicked only once, one click unveils all matching letters in a hidden phrase. The game continues until all letters in the phrase are guessed or there are no "lives" left.<br><br>
